<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use Axway AMPLIFY APIM Service Broker to proxy Pivotal Platform apps. Developers can extend the value of Pivotal Platform by integrating the apps and services running on Pivotal Platform through Axway AMPLIFYâ„¢ API Management. The integration is implemented as a Pivotal Platform Service Broker. With this approach, customers can connect to an existing Axway API Management solution, or they can deploy Axway API Manager on their choice of infrastructure (on-premise or cloud) and integrate it with Pivotal Platform.
</br></br>
A high level architecture that is based on the [Pivotal Platform Fully-Brokered Service pattern](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-7/services/route-services.html#fully-brokered) is shown on the following diagram

The benefits of using the service broker pattern are described in the [overview section](./index.html).
</br></br>

        "uri": "/api/v3/swagger.json"
       }
