This documentation describes the Axway AMPLIFY APIM Service Broker for Pivotal Platform. It enables developers to manage APIs for their Pivotal Platform applications through the API Manager console.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Axway AMPLIFY APIM Service Broker for Pivotal Platform registers a service broker with Pivotal Platform and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating an Axway AMPLIFY APIM Service Broker for Pivotal Platform service instance and binding it to a Pivotal Platform application creates an API Manager front end API that handles requests for the application. This lets developers use the API Manager UI to manage API security, polices enforcement and provide access control to consumers for Pivotal Platform application
